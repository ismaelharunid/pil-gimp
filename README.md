# pil-gimp
A drop in PIL wrapper to emulate gimp, pdb and plugin apis 


# Why?

Because it's easy (although tedious) to create wrappers to emulate cross apis when their functionality is similar and the source code is available. 

More then that because there is a vast amount of plugins, extensions and features for both.  If you can use both at the same time it makes it worthwhile.

# When?

When  have time.  This repo is at present just an idea, certainly only about half of these repos reach maturity but I am pretty sure this one will because it's a very good idea.

# How?

With a little help from my friends or with just a little idle time.

# Where?

What do you mean where?  I don't even know what you're asking.
